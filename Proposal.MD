#Project Proposal#

**Vision statement**: My project is going to be volunteering on a project with an [evolutionary ecology lab](https://lea-lab.org/index.html) for the entirety of the semester. I will be implementing a specific genetic analysis method called [IMAGE](https://github.com/fanyue322/IMAGE) which is accessible as an R package. The overarching goal of the project is to infer genotypes (and thus other cool health information) from DNA methylation data on human populations that are transitioning from subsistence-level living to urban living.

**Motivation:** I am excited about exploring the intersection of ecology and computation through this project. I have always been interested in working with genetic data and this project offers a fantastic opportunity to deepen my knowledge and work towards a specific goal. In addition to learning new things, it will help me get an idea of what grad school and a research career is like.


**Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project.**

Weeks 1-2: Project idea research 
Week 3: Meet with lab contact, write proposal, brush up on R and read about IMAGE. 
Week 4 onwards: 5 hours a week working on project

Specific project goals:
    -Data has been gathered from a longtidual sample of individuals - meaning individuals have been sampled multiple times over their lives. My first goal is to implement IMAGE to extract genotypes and confirm that the samples have been correctly labeled and are in fact from the same person. 
    -Depending on how long it takes me to confirm samples are correctly labelled, the next step would be to ask fun biological questions about the data. 

**Risks to project completion, possibly including:**
    -All coding is done in R, which I have limited experience with
    -I have no genetics background beyond an intro course from my Biology degree
    -IMAGE is a relatively new computational method (2019) so there's not a ton of info out there and my direct lab contact hasn't done it before

**Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above**
    -Spend time learning R basics 
    -I have been given some materials to read to brush up on relevant genetics topics and related research. 
    -My lab contact has not yet used this method but has a colleage who has, so I have someone to ask if I am stuck. There also seems to be good documentation and examples of implementing the package on Github. 

**Project Assessments** - 
    -My main goal is to confirm that samples are correctly labelled. As I am unsure what timing/scale of the data looks like, I will define success as confirming any number of samples - from one to all.
