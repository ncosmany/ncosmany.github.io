# CSPB 3122: Professional Development
Track my progress throughout the course with weekly entries and documents to showcase my work. 

## Weekly Entries 
**Week 1 - 8/30/2024**

My goal for this week was to orient myself with the course expectations and to start defining my goals for the semester. I watched the intro video and posted an intro comment on Piazza. I also had a meeting with career services to think about getting ready for the job search. The advisor also pointed me to some useful resources like O.net and the CU alumni contact page. I did some career exploration via O.net and I'd like to set up some informational interviews with alumni to learn more about potential career paths. I am currently waiting for my account to be authorized. Hopefully that happens soon and next week I can reach out to some folks on the network and set up a few interviews. In the meantime, I looked into some job descriptions for positions I am interested in - mostly entry level data science or data analyst roles. I wrote down a list of some technical requirements that I am unfamiliar with so I will need to look more into those. These could be a good starting point for a larger semester project. Currently my goals for next week are 1) to set up a "master resume" with extensive detail so that I can pull sections from it as I apply to different jobs in the coming months and 2) identify coding project ideas. 


**Week 2 - 9/5/2024**

What did you do last week?

  Last week I had a meeting with career services about some job searching basics. I did some research looking to job postings to get an idea of requirements for different positions. I'm mainly looking into data analytics roles (or maybe a junior ML role if that exists) in industries that overlap with natural sciences or sustainability. I used this info to start putting together some skills that I would like to develop. Some things currently on my list - Power BI, Tensorflow, and SQL. I also have been thinking about whether or not I'd like to go to grad school someday so I used some time this week to look into different areas of research. In my job exploration I ended up finding a part time job to apply to (low hopes but good to practice putting together the submission materials) I also did some reading about github websites and set mine up in a very basic format. Still needs some work. 
 
What do you plan to do this week?

  Currently I am working on defining my goals for this class - trying to decide if I want to go all in on a challenging project or work on small projects to develop specific skills or certs. I've been searching github to get an idea of what a start to finish independent project even looks like. Leaning towards a bigger project just because I haven't done anything like that before. Since I know I want to work with data, my goal is to find a dataset that looks interesting and start to develop project ideas from there. I am also planning to reach out to a contact that works in an evolutionary bio lab to set up an informational interview and learn more about the field (and maybe be able to volunteer?) 

Are there any impediments in your way?

  At the moment my only impediments are self-imposed. I'm feeling slightly overwhelmed by all the information out there and how much I do not know. I am finding it hard to focus in on something.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

Last week was very much a hodge-podge of me reading lots of information and going off on tangents. I think completing the official project proposal and adding in week by week details will help me focus future weeks to be more productive.
