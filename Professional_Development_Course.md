# CSPB 3122: Professional Development
Track my progress throughout the course with weekly entries and documents to showcase my work. 

## Weekly Entries 
**Week 1 - 8/30/2024**

My goal for this week was to orient myself with the course expectations and to start defining my goals for the semester. I watched the intro video and posted an intro comment on Piazza. I also had a meeting with career services to think about getting ready for the job search. The advisor also pointed me to some useful resources like O.net and the CU alumni contact page. I did some career exploration via O.net and I'd like to set up some informational interviews with alumni to learn more about potential career paths. I am currently waiting for my account to be authorized. Hopefully that happens soon and next week I can reach out to some folks on the network and set up a few interviews. In the meantime, I looked into some job descriptions for positions I am interested in - mostly entry level data science or data analyst roles. I wrote down a list of some technical requirements that I am unfamiliar with so I will need to look more into those. These could be a good starting point for a larger semester project. Currently my goals for next week are 1) to set up a "master resume" with extensive detail so that I can pull sections from it as I apply to different jobs in the coming months and 2) identify coding project ideas.
