Hi, I'm Nicole!

I am currently pursuing a post-baccalaureate degree in Computer Science at CU Boulder. In my early career, I worked as a field ecologist specializing in plant identification and vegetation surveys. In addition to extensive data collection, I also built a strong foundation in data entry, quality assurance, and simple analysis. This introduction to the power of data analysis inspired me to jumpstart a career shift into a more data-driven role at the intersection of computer science and the natural sciences.
